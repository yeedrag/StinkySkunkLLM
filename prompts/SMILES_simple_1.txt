[Provide a list of common, simple polymer materials and their corresponding PROPERTY values. SMILES format uses a linear sequence of letters to represent polymers, where each letter stands for an atom, defining the polymer's structure. For example, C=CC=CC=CC=O represents polypropylene oxide), with C for carbon and O for oxygen. Please keep your response structured as a table, with the columns 'Material (in SMILES format)' and 'Value.' Focus on providing a diverse range of well-known, simple polymers as examples, ensuring that there are no repeated materials or value ranges. The values should always be single numbers.
