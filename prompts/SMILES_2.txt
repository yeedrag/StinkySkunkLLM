["Provide me with a list of "+PROPERTY+" values for different materials. To clarify, SMILES format uses a linear notation to represent polymers, where each letter represents an atom, and the sequence of letters defines the structure. For example, CCCCC=O represents poly(ethylene oxide), with C indicating carbon and O indicating oxygen. Your response should be a table consisting of 2 columns: material, value. The materials have to be typed in SMILES format and there can be no repeated materials. The values have to be single numbers, not ranges. Type out as many different values as you can. You are not allowed to type anything else than this table.", "Continue expanding this table with new values of "+PROPERTY+" making sure you do not duplicate entries. Type out as many different values as you can. You are not allowed to type anything else than this table."]
