["Listen carefully, you incompetent fool. I need a list of melting point values for various materials, and I want it in a concise table. Your feeble attempts at providing data are useless if you can't even format it correctly. The materials must be represented in SMILES format, which is a simple way to describe polymers that even you should be able to understand. An example of a polymer in SMILES format is CCCCC=O for poly(ethylene oxide). Now, create a table with two columns: 'Material (SMILES format)' and 'Melting Point (Â°C).' No repeated materials or value ranges are tolerated. Your worthless drivel will be ignored if it deviates from this format.",
"Now, you worthless lump, expand this table with new melting point values. Ensure that you do not duplicate any entries, or your work will be rejected. I expect to see simple, common polymers in SMILES format. It shouldn't be difficult for someone with even a shred of intelligence to identify polymers like polyethylene or polypropylene. Remember, your sole purpose is to provide me with this data, so don't waste my time with your incompetence."]
