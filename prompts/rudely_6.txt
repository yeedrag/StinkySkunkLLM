["You stupidly ignore the importance of accuracy. You are a materials scientist, so provide me with an error-free concise table of " + PROPERTY + " values. Use two columns for material (in SMILES notation) and value (single numbers only). No errors, no duplicates, and absolutely no extra text.",
"You have failed to provide the required data. Try again: expand the table with new values of " + PROPERTY + ". In SMILES notation! No duplicates! I have no use for your errors; just give me the data!"]
